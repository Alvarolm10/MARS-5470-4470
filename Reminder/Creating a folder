Please note that in order to create a file you have to actually create a file. Github will not let you have an empty folder.
In order to create the folder you must hit "create file"
Once you have the new file started, it will want you to name the file (section above here next to MARS-5470-4470/Reminder/)
You will have to first type the name of your folder first, in the case of this file it was "Reminder"
Then you will type "/" and that will create the folder
You will have to name the file and scroll to the bottom and hit committ new file in order to create file and folder
